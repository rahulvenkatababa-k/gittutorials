Before starting any git cmds make sure you have a working repository created under your GitHub account either an empty one or an existing one

1. initialize Git
	git init
	git branch ->>> this is to make sure we are working in the master brnach

2. set up your email id and user name which is related to your  this is one time activity in your system

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

3. check for commit status
	git ststus
4. add files indivially --- or check later steps for entire files
	git add <file name>
	git status
5. once you add files then commit
	git commit -m "commit text"
	git status
6. we need to rename the master to main branch
	git branch -M main
	git branch
7. now copy the repository link which you have created from the browser git hub
	git remote add origin https://github.com/rahulvenkatababa-k/gittutorials.git
	git status
	git remove -v
 Here we are saying where to commit of all the changes and commits we are doing
8. finally push the files/code
	git push -u origin main

9. if any modifications are done locally and you feel these are correct then proceed as below
	git restore Readme.md -> this is to restore the previous file
	git add .  ->>> this is for adding all teh changes to staging env
	git status
	git commit -m " new commit text"
	git push origin main
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to clone a repo

1. go to the location where you want to clone the repo open cmd to that location then get the url from the browser of the respective repo which you wanted to clone

	git clone <url from github related to that repo>
2. if any changes done post you cloned the repo
	cd <the original repo path> if your repo is locally modified
	git status
	git add .
	git commit -m <" commit text">
	git branch
	git push origin main
3. redo step 1 again to get latest ->>> if any repos are cloned for the same rename or delete it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario:- if you have made changes to any document or you felt a newly created file is not needed after git add you can use restore

1. check the git status then restore then status again
	git status
	git add .
	git status
	-->>> above we added a new file
	-->>> now i don't want the new file
	git restore --staged "File name with extension"
	git status
	-->>> here the added files which can be committed will be reverted back to untracked filed
	-->>> same can be performed by using reset instead of restore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
functionalities:-

1. if you wish to see the changes of files which are add but not commited 
	git diff --staged

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching and Merging


1. verify in what branch you are working -->> lets say you are in main branch
	git branch
2. create a branch
	git branch <branch_name>
3. move to new branch
	git checkout <branch_name>
4. verify the status
	git status
5. Do your work once done follow same process of add, commit, status, 
	git add .
	git commit -m "text"
	git status
	git branch
6. Once you are done with the work in this branch switchout to main and merge the branch
	git branch
	git checkout main
	git branch
	git merge <branch_name>
	git status
	git push origin main
7. check logs
	git log
	git log -p -3

# How to resolve the conflicts
Lets say two dev's are working on a project and they want to work separately and merge all branches to main...how do you resolve the conflict?

1. create 2 folders named Developer A and Developer B then clone the main branch onto both the folders
	git clone <repo url>
	cd Application /or the actual reponame
	git branch -->>> here you will see branch is main
	git branch developera
	git status
	git branch
	git checkout developera
	open some files and make modification her i did for read me file
	git status
	git add .
	git commit -m "developer a comment"
	git checkout main
	git merge developera
	git push origin main
2. On developer B folder 
	git branch developer
	git checkout developer
	git branch
	-->> make you changes to the same file
	git add .
	git commit -m "comment of developer b"
	git checkout main
	git merger develoeprb
	git push origin main  -->> here you will get conflict
# to resolve the conflict
	git pull  --> this tells there is a conflict
	-->> after git pull open the same file where you got conflict and see the contents -->> then remove all the headers and dashes and extra entried with alpha numerical generated by git manually then save
	--> same process as before 
	git add .
	git commit -m " comment"
	git push origin main
